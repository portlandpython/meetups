PDX Python Meetup Notes
=======================

This is a list of meetups Portland Python User Groups has had, the talks they contained, and who
gave them. If you attended a meetup and you notice a talk missing or
incorrectly labeled please send a pull request (or at least open an
issue). If you gave a talk and your slides are up on the internet,
please link to them as well as any other relevant information!

Perhaps we can also add notes in here too. This project is young and
still figuring itself out, come talk to us on #pdxpython on
irc.freenode.net or at the meetups that are every second Tuesday at
Urban Airship's office.
